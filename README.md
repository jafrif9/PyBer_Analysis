# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose
The premise of the project was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. From there, a multiple-line graph was created to show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
Upon initial analysis, it can be seen that rural cities had the fewest total rides, the fewest total drivers, and the lowest total fares. However, rural cities did have the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver.

When looking at the above summary dataframe, it can be seen that the opposite is true for urban cities. Urban cities have the largest number of total rides, total drivers, and the greatest total fares, but the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

When analyzing the above multiple-line graph, it can be seen that rural cities consistantly had the lowest total fare for each month in 2019, with a peak of around $500 at April. Suburban cities had a total fare consistantly ranging between roughly $700 and $1500. Urban cities remained on the higher end of the spectrum with their total fares ranging between $1600 and $2500 for the entire year. 

## Summary
A potential reason for the disparity amongst the three city types may be the significantly fewer drivers in the rural cities. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the number of total drivers in rural cities, which will increase the total rides and the total fares, while decreasing the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This would further promote ride share as it would be deemed more accessible to everyone. Another potential solution could be reducing the number of total drivers in urdan cities. This would increase the average fare per driver, however, this could also potentially increase the average fare per ride and deter individuals away from the idea of ride share.
